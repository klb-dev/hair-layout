# HTML CSS

## Project
Working with #100Dev to create a layout of a hair salon website. Layout is on [Ayesha - Hair Salon Template Home 03](https://dribbble.com/shots/6872630-Ayesha-Hair-Salon-Template-Home-03/attachments/6872630-Ayesha-Hair-Salon-Template-Home-03?mode=media) by Ajmal khan. We were told to use float or flexbox, I chose flexbox. Much simpler.

## Utilities
* HTML 5
  * ul, li, classes, main, section
* CSS 3
  * Flexbox
  * text transform

## Learning
I jumped in with the HTML making sure it was semantic. Used classes for styling, created sections to separate each part, and header with nav. The content is not fully formed as there is some lorem involved.

CSS used flex to make the layout similar to the image. I am not sure how to make the border of the background image curved as it is, but I will learn. Fonts are not exact as I was not paying for the font since this is about layout and placement.
